## Role of は

The 「は」 particle is used to indicate that a new topic (subject, object) has been introduced to the conversation. A pointer that emphasises an object to focus on during later parts of the conversation.

**This is the “topic” particle.**

### Example of は usage

> Me) 食べた？ – Did you eat?
>
> You) 食べた。 – I ate.

*(the presumed topic is “you”)*

> Me) アリス**は**食べた？ – Did Alice eat?
>
> You) 食べた。 – She ate.

*(the topic is set to アリス)*

## Role of が

The 「が」 particle is used when the topic is unknown and needs to be identified.

### Example of が usage

> Me) 誰**が**チキンを食べた？ – Who ate the chicken?
>
> You) アリス**が**食べた。 – Alice [is the one who] ate it.
