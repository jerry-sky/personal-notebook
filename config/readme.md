# Config

## Setup

In the same directory as this document there is a file `setup.sh` which copies various config files into all sorts of locations.
It's part of the [standard JRS PC Setup](../main/pc-setup.md) to configure the system and its programs.
Execute it to setup a proper workspace.
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```
