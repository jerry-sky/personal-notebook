## Notes

1. `CTRL + SHIFT + A` $\equiv$ deselect all

2. For copying colors use the eyedropper tool.

3. To duplicate drag the mouse with `ALT` pressed and mouse cursor hovering over the object in question.

4. When exporting, check `Use Artboards` to cut off any vectors that are a little bit off the canvas

5. `CTRL + SHIFT + V` $\equiv$ paste in the same spot as the source object.

6. `CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + D` $\equiv$ transform each
   - Note: objects can't be inside a group otherwise it won't work

7. When changing the path direction (e.g. when working with art brushes), when selected click with the pen tool at one of the ends of the path, try both; then cancel making new path segment

8. `SHIFT + PageUp/Down` $\equiv$ next/previous artboard

9. If you can't make a clipping mask inside of group, just un-group things and try again
