## Loose notes

- string concatenation is evil (in the context of displaying user-facing content)
    even something little as colon in a prefix to a list of things can and should be localised;
    or in other words, retired to some configuration file that holds
    the actual content in given language
- _Polish is hard_
- displaying numbers does also very much differ across many languages and regions
