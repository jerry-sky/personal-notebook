#### The reason this repository came to exist is all the shortcomings of OneNote. Here's a couple:
  - *very poor performance of the browser-based app*
  - *no Linux-based app*
  - *proprietary technology*
  - *very error-prone exporting tools*

The only area in which OneNote is better than any other note-taking app is handwriting. Unfortunately, there is no other solution that has all the capabilities of OneNote and a nice, performant Linux app.

The solution, at least for now, is to use OneNote *only* for handwritten notes and Github repositories, just like this one, as the main solution for note-taking.

Besides, the handwritten notes concern only math-related university subjects or language learning. The rest of the notes, be it the personal notes or IT-related matters can be put into a set of Github-flavoured Markdown documents.
