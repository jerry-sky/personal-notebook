## Useful Git configs
#git #config

- `pull.rebase true` — I better set it up, since I've been doing this, but indirectly through my aliases, Bash functions or via IntelliJ's Git integration 
- `merge.conflictstyle zdiff3` — definitely to check out; it allows you to see the original version from before changes were made to the part where conflict arose, in other words this is the state from the **base commit** #diff
- `rebase.autostash true` — basically what IntelliJ does with their *shelve* functionality when pulling from remote and there have been changes made on the same files
- `push.autoSetupRemote true` — not sure if I have it set up
- `commit.verbose true` — could be added for fun
- `help.autocorrect prompt` — useful #fixtypo
- `diff.algorithm histogram`
	- definitely on the list to set it up 
	- #TODO check how this would be applied to IntelliJ's POV #diff
- `includeIf`
	- #TODO

- `fetch.prune true` and `fetch.prunetags` #TODO
- `diff.context 10`
- `diff.colorMoved` default and `diff.colorMovedWS allow-indentation-change` #TODO 
- `push.followtags true`
- rebasing:
	- `rebase.missingCommitsCheck error`
	- `rebase.updateRefs true`
