## edit Vim macros
#vim #macro #editing

You can easily edit macros without rerecording them from scratch.
1. make some room for temporary macro editing workspace
2. do `"qp` to paste the macro contents
3. edit the macro in the current line
4. do `"qY` to copy the modified macro back to register
\[where `q` is the macro you want to edit\]
