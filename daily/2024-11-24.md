# CSS â€” ungroup content

Use `display: contents;` to make element structurally transparent, to ungroup its children.
The following structure
```html
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Recent articles</h1>
  <p>A look at my recent articles about CSS</p>
</div>
```
after applying 
```css
.page-header {
  display: contents;
}
```
functionally becomes this:
```html
<!-- <div class="page-header"> -->
<h1>Recent articles</h1>
<p>A look at my recent articles about CSS</p>
<!-- </div> -->
```
