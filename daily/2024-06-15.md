## IKEA-based development
#optimal #generator #Unix #data #database

source:https://taylor.town/ikea-oriented-development

- take up as little air as possible
- in #SQL world: basically *don’t do N+1*, which is obvious, don’t do stupid loops in application code if it can be done via O(1) efficient query(ies)
	- sometimes it isn’t obvious, e.g.
		- recursive data fetching (e.g. #trees)
		- listing large sets of data — use generators, or some kind of iterator model, that fetches items on "as-you-go" basis; don’t download it as a big array, chunk it up and process a limited number items at a time
- write repurposable and replaceable code; do it like Unix, a program/function/module is a small part that does one thing (or a small number of things) good
- use standards for input and output, if it can be just a CSV, don't overengineer it


## "seniors"

- being a senior isn't magic
	- you learn more how little you know given field
	- you are more proficient in how to manage things and work your way around problems, becoming a senior developer isn't about suddenly having all the answers in the world
