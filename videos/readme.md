# Video Notes

1. Don't forget about color mastering :P - *not like in Szklarska Poręba Górna video.*

2. When jump-cutting, make sure audio isn't weirdly jumping, if so make a **constant power transition**.

3. Do not use anything below high-bitrate setting. The best solution is just to use the YouTube 1080p preset. Medium bitrate is like lowering the resolution way down. This phenomenon can be very noticeable especially when dealing with videos that contain a lot of movement of a great collection of little details, e.g. a video containing a lot of fast moving trees.
